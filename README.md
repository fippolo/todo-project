# Todo Project
I initially started this project to have a way to plan my daily workflow, then I decided to use it to explore Angular features and to practice deploying with GitHub Actions and GitHub Pages.

## Angular features used
- Standalone components and the application configuration API
- Signals and computed state for UI derivations
- Reactive Forms for task creation and editing
- Angular Material components (toolbar, cards, form fields, inputs, select, slider, toggles, chips)
- CDK Drag and Drop for reordering tasks
- Local storage persistence in the browser

## GitHub Actions and Pages
This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the Angular app and publishes the built `dist` output to GitHub Pages.
